[{"content":"With two bananas, 200 grams of chocolate, and milk, you can make a delicious and decadent **Chocolate Banana Nice Cream**.  It's a healthy-ish, no-churn ice cream alternative.\n\nHere's a recipe:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 ripe bananas, sliced and frozen (at least 4 hours, preferably overnight)\n* 200g good quality chocolate (dark, milk, or a mix!), roughly chopped\n* 1/4 cup milk (any kind will work, but milk or almond milk are good choices)\n* Optional:  A pinch of salt, a teaspoon of vanilla extract, a tablespoon of cocoa powder for extra chocolatey-ness.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Melt the chocolate:**  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler (best) or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring frequently to prevent burning.  Let it cool slightly.\n2. **Blend:** Add the frozen banana slices to a food processor or high-powered blender.  Blend until it's a smooth, creamy consistency. This might take a few minutes and you may need to stop and scrape down the sides.\n3. **Combine:**  Add the melted chocolate and milk to the blended bananas.  If using, add the salt and vanilla extract now. Blend again until everything is thoroughly combined and smooth.  If it's too thick, add a little more milk, a tablespoon at a time.\n4. **Freeze (optional):** For a firmer consistency, transfer the mixture to a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 30 minutes to an hour.  This step isn't strictly necessary, but it will make it more like traditional ice cream.\n5. **Serve:** Scoop and enjoy immediately!  You can add toppings like chopped nuts, extra chocolate shavings, or fresh berries.\n\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n\n* **Frozen Bananas are Key:**  The frozen bananas are crucial for the creamy texture.  Make sure they are very ripe before freezing.\n* **Good Quality Chocolate:**  The better the chocolate, the better the nice cream will taste.\n* **Adjust Sweetness:** If your bananas aren't very sweet, you can add a little honey or maple syrup to taste.\n* **Experiment with Flavors:** Feel free to experiment with different types of milk, extracts, or toppings to create your own unique flavor combinations.\n\n\nEnjoy your homemade Chocolate Banana Nice Cream!","additional_kwargs":{},"response_metadata":{"prompt_feedback":{"block_reason":0,"safety_ratings":[]},"finish_reason":"STOP","safety_ratings":[]},"type":"ai","name":null,"id":"run-3c101cac-5c4f-4e74-8e1d-06f1692366cb-0","example":false,"tool_calls":[],"invalid_tool_calls":[],"usage_metadata":{"input_tokens":35,"output_tokens":510,"total_tokens":545,"input_token_details":{"cache_read":0}}},{"content":"Great!  400 grams of strawberries add a fantastic fresh element.
